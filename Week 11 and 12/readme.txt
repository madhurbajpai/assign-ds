Week 11 and 12

In this week we learnt about
1. Threaded Binary tree - We learnt about threaded binary tree that a
    threaded binary tree is a type of binary tree data structure where 
    the empty left and right child pointers in a binary tree are replaced 
    with threads that link nodes directly to their in-order predecessor 
    or successor, thereby providing a way to traverse the tree without 
    using recursion or a stack.

2. Tournament Tree - We learnt that in the naive selection sort, it takes 
    O(n) operations to select the next element of n elements; in a tournament 
    sort, it takes O(log n) operations (after building the initial tournament 
    in O(n)). Tournament sort is a variation of heapsort.

3. B+ Tree - We learnt that B + tree is a variation of B-tree data structure.
    The leaf nodes have an entry for every value of the search field, along with
    a data pointer to the record (or to the block that contains this record).
    The leaf nodes of the B+ tree are linked together to provide ordered access 
    on the search field to the records.
