Week 10

In this week we learnt about
1. AVL Trees - In AVL Trees we learnt about insertion in the tree and how to balance the tree after 	insertion
    	when the balance factor of the node in any except -1, 0 and 1.

2. RedBlack Tree - In red black tree we learnt that red-Black tree is a binary search tree in which 	every node is colored with either red or black. It is a type of self balancing binary search 	tree.
3. Splay Tree - In splay tree, we learnt that the tree automatically reorganizes itself so that 	frequently accessed or inserted elements become closer to the root node.

4. Hash Table - In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its 	own unique index value. Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired 	data.
5. 2-3 tree - A 2-3 Tree is a type of tree in data structures in which every node of the tree is 	either a 2 node
   	or 3 nodes. It is a special type of B-Tree with order 3.
    	A 2 node in the tree is one which has one data part and two child nodes.
    	A 3 node in the tree is one which has two data parts and three child nodes.
6. 2-3-4 tree - A 2-3-4 tree is a self-balancing tree. The number represents the number of children 	each node can have. Any internal node can have either two, three, or four child nodes. It is 	also called a 2-4 tree.
