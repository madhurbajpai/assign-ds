Week 7

In this week we learnt about
1. Binary Search Tree - Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data 
    structure which has the following properties:
    The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the 
    node’s key.
    The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the 
    node’s key.
    The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
2. Binary Tree - A binary tree is a rooted tree that is also an ordered tree 
    in which every node has at most two children. A rooted tree naturally imparts 
    a notion of levels (distance from the root), thus for every node a notion 
    of children may be defined as the nodes connected to it a level below.
