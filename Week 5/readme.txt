Objective - Implementation of Infix to Postfix conversion, implementaion of josephus problem, singly, doubly and circular linked list

My Approach---
In infix to postfix conversion we use stack to store the parantheses, operators and operands.
To implement Josephus Problem we implement the concept of queue.
For linked list we create the header file and implements operation on linked list as insertion at front and end, and a given position and so for circular and doubly linked list.
