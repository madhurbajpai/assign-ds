Week 16 and 17

In this week we learnt about
1. Order Statistics Tree - We learnt that in computer science, an order 
    statistic tree is a variant of the binary search tree that supports 
    two additional operations beyond insertion, lookup and deletion.
    Select(i) – find the i'th smallest element stored in the tree
    Rank(x) – find the rank of element x in the tree, i.e. its index in 
    the sorted list of elements of the tree
    Both operations can be performed in O(log n) worst case time when a 
    self-balancing tree is used as the base data structure.
2. Birthday Program - In this program, we implement program to store the
    name and date of birth. Also we sort the names according to the age 
    and also generate the happy birthday message.

    storing name and items name 0f 50 items and students. Also we calculate
