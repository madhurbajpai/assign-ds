Week 14 and 15

In this week we learnt about
1. Deapth First Search - Depth-first search is an algorithm 
    for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
    So the basic idea is to start from the root or any 
    arbitrary node and mark the node and move to the adjacent 
    unmarked node and continue this loop until there is no 
    unmarked adjacent node.
2. Breadth First Search - Breadth-first search (BFS) is an 
    algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node 
    that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree 
    root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to 
    moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
3. Topological Sort - Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic 
    Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for 
    every directed edge u v, vertex u comes before v in the 
    ordering.
4. Minimum Spanning Tree - A minimum spanning tree (MST) or 
    minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected, 
    undirected graph is a spanning tree with a weight less than 
    or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. 
    In Kruskalâ€™s algorithm, sort all edges of the given graph 
    in increasing order. Then it keeps on adding new edges and 
    nodes in the MST if the newly added edge does not form a 
    cycle. It picks the minimum weighted edge at first at the 
    maximum weighted edge at last.
