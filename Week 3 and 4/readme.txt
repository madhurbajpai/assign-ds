Objectives - Polynomial addition and polynomial multiplication using arrays, sparse matrix multiplication, stack, queues

We store the polynomial using arrays as index is the power of the variable say x and the data in that index is the coefficient of varaible x. Then we perform the operation of addition and multiplication.
Then, we did the sparse matrix multiplication.
We create stack and different operation on the stack as push, pop. We also create queue and operation on the queue
